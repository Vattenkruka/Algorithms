# Slide the pyramid case

## Description of the Case
    You're about to compete at sliding down a pyramid and to win you need to take the fastest path to
    the bottom.
### Rules
    1. You always start from the top and have to find your way to the bottom.
    2. You can only slide to the two adjacent fields downwards.
    3. The number in each field represents how much you'll be slowed down by friction.
    4. The fastest route is the route that has the lowset sum of all the fields passed through.

## About the Project
    A program that solves the shortest slide path of the pyramid. 
    The input will be provided in the form of a number of telling you how many layers there will be and
    after that one layer per row with spaces between the values per layer.
## How To Run the Project
    1. Unzip the project folder.
    2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
